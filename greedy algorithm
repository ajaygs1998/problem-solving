//A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting
//the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result.

//The algorithm never reverses the earlier decision even if the choice is wrong. It works in a top-down approach.

Advantages of Greedy Approach:
>The algorithm is easier to describe.
>This algorithm can perform better than other algorithms (but, not in all cases).


However, we can determine if the algorithm can be used with any problem if the problem has the following properties:

1. Greedy Choice Property

If an optimal solution to the problem can be found by choosing the best choice at each step without reconsidering the previous steps once chosen, the problem can be solved using a greedy approach.
This property is called greedy choice property.

2. Optimal Substructure

If the optimal overall solution to the problem corresponds to the optimal solution to its subproblems, then the problem can be solved using a greedy approach. This property is called optimal substructure.
